# 🚗 EV Market Segmentation Analysis - Feynn Labs Internship

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Feynn Labs Consultancy Services**, where I performed **market segmentation** analysis in the **Electric Vehicle (EV)** sector in India.

## 📌 Objective

To understand consumer segments within the EV market using clustering and segmentation techniques based on survey data from McDonald's-style marketing format. This helps businesses better target their products and services to specific customer groups.


## 🔍 Project Summary

* **Domain:** Market Research / EV Industry
* **Goal:** Identify meaningful customer segments using unsupervised learning
* **Dataset Used:** `mcdonalds.csv` – contains responses to consumer preferences and choices
* **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Google Colab

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * Null value handling
  * Data scaling and normalization
  * Label encoding / One-hot encoding

* **Segmentation Techniques:**

  * K-Means Clustering
  * Hierarchical Clustering
  * Dendrogram Analysis
  * Silhouette Score Evaluation
  * PCA for dimensionality reduction

* **Visualization:**

  * Cluster plots
  * Pair plots
  * Heatmaps
  * Dendrograms

## 🧪 Analysis Done

* Segmented users into 3–4 distinct groups based on behavioral patterns.

* Each segment reflected a different **market persona**:

  * **Eco-conscious EV Adopters**
  * **Price-Sensitive Buyers**
  * **Performance-Oriented Users**
  * **Skeptical Traditionalists**

* Explored:

  * **Cluster consistency**
  * **Feature contribution**
  * **Brand preferences across segments**
